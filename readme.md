# KinGames
KinGames is a fullstack web app, created using Django and React.  
This app was build by Ilya Makarov, KPI University student from Kiev, as a  
final project in EPAM Systems academy.  

The topic of website is internet shop for gamers, which provides an userfriendly interface for buying computer games.   
KinGames provides some comfortable features for filtering and searching games, in order to get exactly customer wants.

------------------
Anyway, unauthenticated users can use 100% of websites power. So lets dive into accounts.  <br />

We can just click on "Sing in" button at the top of the screen. <br/>

-----------------
        There are 3 types of accounts in KinGames: 
            - Users
            - Managers
            - Admins
        
        First is just a regular user, which can comment 
        games, and put his marks. Managers and Admins can 
        add new games, edit or delete excisting. Also both
        of them can delete users comments, if they disrupt
        KinGames chant rules. But anyway, edit comment can 
        only its author. The difference between Admins and 
        Managers is that admins can create new managers.

-----------------

Now I singed in Admin account, so that there is nothing I can not do now.  <br/>
